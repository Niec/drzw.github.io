      <h2>Educational Background</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>From the tranquil surroundings of Baylor University, I embarked on a journey of discovery from August 2016 to December 2019, culminating in a Doctorate in Mechanical Engineering. My academic aspirations were further ignited during my Master's studies from August 2014 to August 2016. Prior to my international pursuits, I honed my foundational skills in Mechanical Design, Manufacturing, and Automation at the esteemed Dalian University of Technology from September 2010 to June 2014.</p>
